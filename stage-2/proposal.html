        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Scientists have dubbed the time period we are currently in as the “point of no return,” from an 
            environmental perspective. Because of increasing carbon emissions and the unethical and immense 
            usage of natural resources, it is said that we are currently in a critical position that determines 
            what consequences will happen to our planet. This pressure has brought a new wave of environmentalism 
            and environmental activism into full swing, with many people scared of the potentially 
            catastrophic climate situation that may await us if we do not act in a sustainable and 
            environmentally-friendly way on a mass scale. One major issue with this movement is that because 
            of the way information is overloaded upon us in this day and age, it can become overwhelming for 
            the average citizen to act in a way that is environmentally responsible, solely because they are 
            not sure what exactly they can do with their limited knowledge and resources. As a result, 
            someone who is concerned with this issue could become overwhelmed with the information coming 
            up them from a corporation perspective, a food industry perspective, an animal perspective, a 
            natural disaster perspective, and much more. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that in a field that is so confusing but needs immediate action for many people, a well 
            designed web app could significantly help. The information problems related to environmentally 
            friendly and sustainable lifestyles that remain to be addressed is the way the information is so 
            broad and not easily accessible. There are many sites that specialize in different fields of 
            environmentalism, and many can also be too in-depth for the average citizen with limited means. 
            Although there are a few websites that already exist, there are aspects of them that are still 
            not satisfactory. For example, the website <cite><a href="https://greenamerica.org/green-living">Green 
            Living</a></cite>, a somewhat known site that “shares tips 
            on how to make the greenest decisions that affect your home, family, and community” has this same 
            underlying idea of presenting information to the average person to be able to easily implement, 
            but in reality, when one visits the site, the information is conceptually focus rather than 
            implementation-focused. For example, the “Food” tab of the site focuses on Industrial Agriculture 
            and other “big picture” food and climate relations, but doesn’t have much that the average person 
            can do to make a difference, like veganism information, vegetarian or vegan meals, or stores 
            that grow and sell produce ethically. Another eco-friendly lifestyle website called <cite><a 
            href="https://inhabitat.com/">Inhabitat</a></cite> 
            faces similar issues. First of all, it is not very user-friendly because the entire site is just 
            a collection of various articles from different authors and sources and it isn’t well-organized 
            for easy accessibility. Additionally, the site is just very conceptual and theory based - it 
            doesn’t offer much of a lifestyle suggestion or eco-friendly changes the average person can make. 
            This issue needs to be addressed with a solution that places the user first, and is geared towards 
            easily accessible information that people can utilize to make lifestyle changes that are more 
            eco-friendly.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The users of this app are average people who are looking to lead more environmentally-friendly 
            lifestyles with the limited resources and abilities they have. The users of this application 
            are more interested in sharing and discovering ways to make their daily lives more eco-friendly, 
            and less interested about the big picture/informational side of environmentalism that are 
            provided by other more technical websites, books, and scientific reports. Because the user base 
            is people with varying ranges of ability, financial status, and with varying levels of commitment 
            to the environment and leading environmentally friendly lifestyles, this application will be able 
            to cater to people on all ranges of the spectrum. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will use the web application to post and interact with other users who are involved in 
            trying to lead more environmentally sustainable lifestyles. It will be a sort of social media 
            application, but all posts will revolve around environmentalism and be separated by distinct 
            categories and tags within the categories. Users determine tags with their posts, but the set 
            categories on the site’s structure is “Health,” “Diet,” “Reducing Waste in the Home,” and 
            “Sustainable Energy Sources,” as some broad examples. Users then choose a category, and 
            they can either browse through posts and interact with them, by liking, disliking, commenting 
            on, saving, or reporting posts, or post something for themselves. A user has to have an account 
            and log in to their account to be able to post, and they are able to post pictures and/or text,
            and have the ability to tag their post with more specific vegans under the category they chose to 
            post in. As an example, they can tag their post as “vegan protein source” under “vegan,” 
            under the broad category of "Diet". In this way, this application “nests” users’ posts in a 
            category-based way that makes it easily accessible, and because of the nature of the site, 
            the information will be implementable environmentally-friendly tips. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This app serves as a solution to the aforementioned problem because it offers a platform 
            that is specifically oriented towards implementing more environmentally-sustainable practices 
            in the average person’s daily life, in ways that are tried, tested, and recommended by other 
            users. It isn’t just a technical informational source, and because of the posting element, 
            there are always new tips and information circulating through the site, which keeps it from 
            being stagnant. Additionally, the nested way it is organized, in broad categories and then 
            tagged with more specific keywords, keeps the information organized and makes it easier for 
            users to find and access what they are looking for. This proposed application is a much more 
            cohesive solution than other existing sites.

            <h3>App Functionality User Flow</h3>
            <p>
                An example of a user looking to make a post step by step. In this example, the user wants to recommend
                a specific toothbrush brand that uses bamboo instead of plastic as a step towards less plastic waste. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The user will need to log into their account.</li>
                <li>Because they want to make a post, they can hit the plus button at the top of their 
                    screen that indicates a new post.</li>
                <li>After they write their post in the text box and/or attach an image, they have to
                    choose a broad general category that their post fits in. (i.e. Diet, Health, Zero Waste,
                    Reuse, Thrifting, etc.) from a scrolling selection box. In this hypothetical situation, the user would write up their post
                    and select it to be the in Zero Waste category and click on that.</li>
                <li>Next, the user has the ability to refine the categorization of the post even more
                    by using tags. To do so, they can go to the "Tags" text box of the post screen and 
                    type the tags to use preceded by a hashatg symbol. In this hypotheical situation,
                    one could tag their post with "#dental" or "#bathroom."</li>
                <li>Now that the user has created their post, they will be able to click the 
                    post button and publish their post.</li>
                <li>If people comment on their post, they will recieve a notification and be able to 
                    comment back to the other user and engage in discourse, by hitting the reply button on
                    a comment they recieve.</li>
            </ol>
